## Introduction

"This is the source code for our proof of concept (PoC) on the reduction rate of communication overhead in federated learning."

## Datasets

First one [Milano](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aKh1icdmK9ho3mOZiNg593ivgIeycWKz/view?usp=sharing) and second one [Trentino](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R-hrUVS1TY6Eec6k6aN_ce4u56LeYNHv/view?usp=sharing)

## Goal

"Data generated in mobile communication networks is vast and originates in a distributed environment. Centralized learning approaches require unnecessary communication processes due to this. Federated learning can address this challenge. The objective of this test is to measure the reduction in communication overhead when federated learning is applied."

## Description

"We aim to use publicly available wireless traffic data from mobile communication networks to compare the communication overhead between federated learning applied in a distributed environment and centralized learning. The purpose is to ascertain the reduction percentage in communication volume attributable to federated learning. The total reduction rate for communication volume during learning is defined as follows."

- Total communication overhead for learning = Federated learning communication overhead / Centralized learning communication overhead
